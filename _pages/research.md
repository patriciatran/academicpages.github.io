## What are microbes doing under ice?
The majority of freshwater lakes in the Northern hemisphere are ice-covered for several months of the year. Traditionally, it was thought that organisms were "dormant" under the ice. However, recent reviews on physical and chemical parameters show the importance of the winter period on successional season, and that macro-organisms such as under-ice phytoplankton growth can enhance microbial growth, grazing on them. 
As part of my M.Sc. research, I studied three lakes in temperate and boreal Quebec, to investigate which microbes were really abundant under the ice of freshwater lakes, and I used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate their metabolism. We found that a group of freshwater bacteria, Verrucomicrobia, were dominant members of under-ice lakes, making up to a third of all microbes, much more than any other time of the year! Additionally, we found that organic compounds that were produced by organisms during the summer, may sink and be inaccessible to the "consumers" until a later point in the year -- thus showing the importance of spatio-temporal availability of nutrients in lake nutrient cycling.

## How are changing oxygen gradients affecting microbial ecology?
Freshwater lakes encounter a variety of changing environmental conditions: from below freezing air temperatures during winter, to cool spring air, to hot summer days. These environmental changes have direct effects on how temperature and oxygen is distributed in freshwater lakes. In aquatic ecosystems, the majority of animals require oxygen to breathe -- to live. However, microbes are extremely diverse and can live without oxygen -- how exactly are they contributing to overall lake ecology?
For my Ph.D. dissertation, I hope to learn more about microbial ecology and metabolism in the anoxic zones of freshwater lakes, and use that information to inform useful model of lake water quality. Anoxia is a growing problem in aquatic environments across the globes, and understanding the effects of these zones on biology requires a thorough understanding of microbial ecology and metabolism in those zones.

### Our first study site:
Lake Tanganyika, the second deepest lake on Earth, and largest body of anoxic surface freshwater is our first site. Using metagenomics, we are hoping to investigate the difference or similarities between the oxygenated and fully anoxic layers of lake Tanganyika, and how it compares to freshwater lakes worldwide. Additionally, we created a free, open-source metagenomic analysis software, [METABOLIC](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/METABOLIC), to facilitate these types of analyses.  

### Our second study site:
Lake Mendota, is a temperate dimictic lake located near UW-Madison. It is part of the NSF Long Term Ecology - North Temperate Lakes [NTL-LTER](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/), and the LTER-MO (Microbial Observatory). These long standing monitoring programs constitute a rich dataset of historical, and current, limnological parameters and species composition and change. The bottom of Lake Mendota is anoxia for several months during the late summer. As part of my research, I'm zooming into the role of microbes in the hypolimnion of Lake Mendota, and using biogeochemical, physical and biological measurements to investigate the role of microbes in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling. 

## How can this information be useful?
Building upon our knowledge of microbial ecology, who is there, what do they do, and how they contribute to carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling, I'm hoping to use that information to incorporate a "microbial" component to lake biogeochemical and water quality models. Currently, mainstream water quality models oversimplify, or don't account for microbial metabolism, which could lead to an underestimation of outputs such as carbon cycling, especially in environments where anoxia is prominent, and microbes are the main biological members.

## Software Development
"-Omics" data is being generated at an unprecedented rate. Tools to facilitate analysis and interpretation of these data in an ecological context are needed. My colleagues and I developed the software METABOLIC to facilitate such tasks.
