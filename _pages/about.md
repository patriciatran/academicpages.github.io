I'm a research scientist interested in microbial ecology, biogeochemistry and bioinformatics. My expertise is in aquatic ecology and how we can leverage multidisciplinary approaches to better understand the role of microbes in ecosystems. My current research is on microbial communities and metabolism in anoxic lakes, and the implications for biogeochemical cycling.

I obtained my M.Sc. from Concordia University in 2018, and my B.Sc. Honours from McGill University in 2016. I am currently a PhD Candidate in [Freshwater and Marine Science](https://fms.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsn-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I am co-advised my [Dr. Trina McMahon](https://mcmahonlab.wisc.edu/) and [Dr. Karthik Anantharaman](https://anantharamanlab.com/)
